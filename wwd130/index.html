    <h2>Jaden Binette</h2>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>    Hi my name is Jaden, I'm from Virginia in the United States. <br> <br>
        
        I am working towards a degree in networking and computer science as well as learning new skills  <br>
        every day. Looking at the different options I had for courses, web design stood out as something  <br>
        that impacts all of my potential career paths. Because of this I hope to learn all I can  <br>
        in this class to build my own web presence. I work in real estate doing sales, <br>
        CAD, and photography for a local home improvement company.  <br>
        When I'm not in school or working I have many hobbies including music production,  <br>
        photography, and virtual reality. I look forward to working with all of you! 
    </p>
