      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People are going to come to my website because they are looking
        to see what I can do with my camera. They are looking for information
        on booking,  prices, the work that ive done, and what I offer for 
        services. Once they get into the site they need to see some of my work
        front and center at a decent resolution to where they can see the
        quality but not too much that it makes the site slow. The idea is
        to have evenly spaced buttons with the pictures inside of them to
        take them to the respective subpage that showes the work in more
        detail along with a small effect that shows that you are interacting
        with the page.
      
        On the top of the page my logo 
        is going to be top center as the home button while being flanked by 
        “work” and “contact” following the color scheme. There will be a 
        minimallistic theme that accentuates the photos in the showcase. 
        This includes a flat grey backround and simmilar layout to other photography 
        websites. 

        The information that ill need in my website is going to be large, 
        this includes all the pictures that I think are important as well as 
        an area for references and a bio section. All of this needs to be put 
        in an acessable way that lets people see what they need to first while 
        not having any non important information the website also needs to look 
        moddern and clean as to not distract from the pictures that it is trying 
        to showcase. There needs to be information on where I am located, what 
        services I provide, and how much some of these cost on the spot as well 
        as different price options.

      <h3>Work showcase</h3>
      <p>
        On the work page there will be subpages that contain the
         appropreate work in a compressed form to make it load faster 
         as well as a larger image to see in fullscreen mode there will 
         be three to start with but the layout will be made in a way that 
         it can be expanded later on and keep the form it is in now.

      <h3>Contact Page</h3>
      <p>
        The other option in the home page will be a page to contact.  
        In this page there will be a picture of me aswell as a banner 
        image to add a splash of color. Inside of this there is going to be 
        my name and a small bio something along the lines of “I surve the dc 
        metro area and will travel to seal the memories of your event forever. 
        Call or email to schedule a consult.”there will also be a rough pricing 
        guide at the bottom of the page allowing people to get an idea what they 
        are getting into. 

        Through the website the visitors will want to find a way to contact 
        me and what the process of some of these activities are going to be.  
        The information thats there needs to be presented in a professional way 
        as to make the potential customer want to get in contact with me to schedule 
        a call or meeting to discuss what the best option for them is going to be.
